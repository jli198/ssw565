# Project Description

Please select one of the following project options relating to software architecture, or propose your own topic that aligns with your interests and work. If you have a different topic in mind, please discuss it with me so we can scope it appropriately for the semester-long project.

## Option 1: Stack4Things Architecture Analysis and Redesign

*Objective:* Understand the architecture of Stack4Things, a framework for managing Internet of Things (IoT) resources using OpenStack, and propose improvements to meet scalability and quality attribute goals.

**P1. Introduction and Summary:**

* Download and run the lightning-rod and standalone versions of Stack4Things from [here](https://github.com/MDSLab/stack4things).
* Review the project documentation and listed publications to understand the applicationâ€™s objectives, stakeholders, user stories, and requirements.
* Write a brief summary covering these elements based on your understanding.

**P2. Quality Attribute Analysis:**

* Identify significant quality attribute scenarios (e.g., performance, security, modifiability).
* Evaluate the business risks and architectural significance of these scenarios.
* Complete a utility tree to document the quality attributes and their priority.

**P3. Risk Assessment and Improvement Suggestions:**

* Assess the current architecture and identify potential risks or areas for improvement, such as security, performance, or scalability.
* Propose architectural tactics to address these concerns.

**P4. Architectural Proposal:**

* Based on anticipated user growth (30,000 monthly active users in 3 months and 300,000 in 12 months), propose a scalable backend architecture.
* Include architectural patterns, quality attributes, and tactics in your proposal.
* Document your design using a C4 model or 4+1 view.

*Deliverables:*

* 3-5 page technical report covering P1-P4.
* A 5-minute presentation summarizing your findings and architectural proposal.

## Option 2: OpenStack Code Review Analysis

*Objective:* Automate and optimize the code review process in OpenStack repositories by categorizing check-ins based on their architectural attributes.

**P1. Code Check-in Clustering:**

* Export a list of more than 500 code check-ins from [OpenDev](https://review.opendev.org/) or use the provided [file](Code_Review_Project.csv).
* Cluster the check-ins based on architectural attributes (e.g., documentation, performance, security).
* Analyze the statistics of the clusters, their percentage distribution, and the challenges in detecting certain clusters.

**P2. Machine Learning Assistance:**

* Explore if any types of check-ins can be auto-evaluated using machine learning methods.
* Propose a method or model for automated evaluation.

**P3. Security Check-in Analysis:**

* Review the attached security-related check-ins (Security_Code_Review_Project-2.csv).
* Propose further categorization or analyze the interaction between security-related features and other quality attributes, like performance and modifiability.

*Deliverables:*

* 3-5 page technical report covering at least one of the questions in P1, P2, or P3.
* A 5-minute presentation summarizing your findings and proposed solutions.

## Option 3: LLM-based Software Architecture Design

*Objective:* Explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT for software architecture design, development, and testing.

1. **Proof of Concept:**

* Read the paper on leveraging ChatGPT for software design (linkLinks to an external site.).
* Develop a proof of concept for an online exchange system from design to development and testing using ChatGPT as a collaborative tool.

*Deliverables:*

* 3-5 page technical report on your proof of concept, including design decisions, implementation, and testing results.
* A 5-minute presentation demonstrating the workflow and outcomes.

## Option 4: Self-Selected Project

*Objective:* Choose a topic related to software architecture that aligns with your interests or professional work.

* Propose your own project idea and discuss it with me to ensure it fits the scope and learning objectives of the course.
* Develop a project plan and deliverables to be completed over the semester.

*Deliverables:*

* 3-5 page technical report or equivalent documentation.
* A 5-minute presentation summarizing your project and findings.
