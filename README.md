## COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course provides the student with working knowledge of terms, principles, and methods of Software Architecture and Component-Based Design, introducing students to a wide variety of processes and alternatives that can be deployed in creating and/or evaluating software architectures and designs. Numerous case studies of working software architectures are studies and the student will acquire an appreciation of the role that software architecture and design activites play in the acquisiton and/or development of complex software-intensive systems. </br>
</br>
Special consideration is given to the role of architecture and design in software assurance for dependability, including performance, reliability and security. Recent advances in design techniques, software patterns, component-based design and design refactoring are introduced.

## STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES

After successful completion of this course, students will be able to...

* Construct an architecture using the "4+1" model, emphasizing architectural styles and nonfunctional requirements
* Base software design on components, patterns and classes using a domain driven approach
* Re-factor code to improve understanding or modification
* Apply a continuous learning approach to sotware architecture and design

## COURSE FORMAT AND STRUCTURE

This course to a synchronous in-person class. To access the course, please [visit](stevens.edu/canvas). For more information about course access or support, contact the Technology Resource and Assistance Center (TRAC) by calling 201-216-5500.

### Course Logistics

Weekly modules consist of presentation material (slides and occasional recorded videos for live sessions in an emergency), assigned and sometimes optional reading, as well as discussions and assignments. Each week, we will have live in-person session for main presentation. For student who cannot attend the in-person session, the recordings can be reviewed. </br>
</br>
Graded discussions (on Canvas) are a key component of this course. To participate in a weekly discussion, you must provide your initial contribution to the discussion by two days before the class of that week at midnight and respond to at least one other student's contribution by the day of the class at 11:59pm. Contributions must be substantive--just saying that you agree or disagree without providing reasons is not sufficient to fulfill the assignment. Points will be deducted for initial contributions, and contributions and comments cannot be provided after the discussion closes at 11:59pm on the day before the clas. (All time refers to Eastern Time). </br>
</br>
Graded Assignments and Group Assignments are due on the day before the class meeting at 11:59pm. </br>
</br>
Course project will be released after the 3rd week. Mid-point check at 6th week, Final report and presentation are required for the final week. </br>
</br>
A final examination covering the entire course's content will be given during the Final Exam and Review period.

### Instructor's Online and In-office Hours

I will be available via email and respond as soon as I am availble (generally within 24-48 hrs). For the onlne discussions, I will check in at least three times per week. Keep in mind that it is not possible for me to respond to every single posting every week (nor is it pedagogically appropriate), but I will be sure to respond to various postings and students each week and attempt to assure equality in terms of responses to students. Furthermore, there is a specific discussion forum that you can use to ensure that you have my attnetion - to ask questions or to call my attention to a particular discussion you are engaged in that you would like me to take a look at. If you feel you are being neglected in any way, please contact me. When emailing me, pleas eplace in the subject line the course number/section and the topic of the email (i.e., SSW 565 - Assignment 2 Question). This will help me tremendously in locating your emails quicker.

### Office Hours

Office Hours are a synchronous session (in person or Zoom) to discuss questions related to weekly readings and/or assignments. Office hours will be determined first week of class.

### Online Etiquette Guidelines

Your instructor and fellow students wish to foster a safe online learning environment during the online sessions. No matter how different or controversial they may be perceived, all opinions and experiences must be respected in the tolerant spirit of academic discourse. You are encouraged to comment, question, or critique an idea, but you cannot attack an individual. Our differences, some of which are outlined in the University's inclusion statement below, will add richness to this learning experience. Please consider that sarcasm and humor can be misconstrued in online interactions and generate unintended disruptions. Working as a community of learners, we can build a polite and respectful course ambiance. Please read the Netiquette rules for this course:

* Do not dominate any discussion. Allow other students to join in the discussion.
* Do not use offensive language. Present ideas appropriately.

### Academic Integrity

### Undergraduate Honor System

Enrollment into the undergraduate class of Stevens Institute of Technology signifies a student's commitment to the Honor System. Accordingly, the provisions of the Stevens Honor System apply to all undergraduate students in coursework and Honor Board proceedings. It is the responsibility of each student to become acquainted with and to uphold the ideals set forth in the Honor System Constitution. More information about the Honor System including the constitution, bylaws, investigative procedures, and the penalty matrix can be found [online](http://web.stevens.edu/honor/). </br>
</br>
The following pledge shall be written in full and signed by every student on all submitted work (including, but not limited to, homework, projects, lab reports, code, quizzes and exams) that is assigned by the course instructor. No work shall be graded unless the pledge is written in full and signed. </br>
</br>
***I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.*** </br>
</br>
*Reporting Honor System Violations* </br>
Students who believe a violation of the Honor System has been committed should report it within ten business days of the suspected violation. Students have the option to remain anonymous and can report violations [online](www.stevens.edu/honor).

### Graduate Student Code of Academic Integrity

All Stevens graduate students promise to be fully truthful and avoid dishonesty, fraud, misrepresentation, and deceit of any type in relation to their academic work. A student’s submission of work for academic credit indicates that the work is the student's own. All outside assistance must be acknowledged. Any student who violates this code or who knowingly assists another student in violating this code shall be subject to discipline. </br>
</br>
All graduate students are bound to the Graduate Student Code of Academic Integrity by enrollment in graduate coursework at Stevens. It is the responsibility of each graduate student to understand and adhere to the Graduate Student Code of Academic Integrity. More information including types of violations, the process for handling perceived violations, and types of sanctions can be found [here](www.stevens.edu/provost/graduate-academics).

### Special Provisions for Undergraduate Students in 500-level Courses

The general provisions of the Stevens Honor System do not apply fully to graduate courses, 500 level or otherwise. Any student who wishes to report an undergraduate for a violation in a 500-level course shall submit the report to the Honor Board following the protocol for undergraduate courses, and an investigation will be conducted following the same process for an appeal on false accusation described in Section 8.04 of the Bylaws of the Honor System. Any student who wishes to report a graduate student may submit the report to the Dean of Graduate Academics or to the Honor Board, who will refer the report to the Dean. The Honor Board Chairman will give the Dean of Graduate Academics weekly updates on the progress of any casework relating to 500-level courses. For more information about the scope, penalties, and procedures pertaining to undergraduate students in 500-level courses, see Section 9 of the Bylaws of the Honor System document, located on the Honor Board website.
